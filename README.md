Hi I am Enemoy

I am a learning monitoring engineer and system administrator, a big (Arch) Linux enthusiast and study philosophy in Germany.

I code mainly in Bash and Python and write scripts to speed up my workflow in e.g. writing documents with LaTeX.

Bye bye and I hope you can make use of my zettelkasten repository or other scripts.
